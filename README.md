my current magnum opus, its just a cli tool for every warhammer 40k faction, plus a search tool and way to check the datacards of the factions. however GW decided to fuck us and removed the community links to see the datacards so thats deprecated, so dont even bother trying to check that out, anyways, tutorial:

run the exe, ./main, ./main.exe whatever, then explore the tool

k thanks, make sure to star the repo, follow me my github and follow my twitch and twitter(x)

also, if you want to know where the logic is, its in cmd/multiInput
