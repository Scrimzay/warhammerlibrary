my current magnum opus, its just a cli tool for every warhammer 40k faction, basically my own black library, plus a search tool and way to check the datacards of the factions. however GW decided to fuck us and removed the community links to see the datacards so thats deprecated, so dont even bother trying to check that out, anyways, tutorial:

run the exe, ./warhammerlibrary search, ./warhammerlibrary.exe search, whatever, then explore the tool

k thanks, make sure to star the repo, follow me on github and follow my twitch and twitter(x)

also, if you want to know where the logic is, its in cmd/multiInput

also also, if you do want to check the datacards (cause youre a WH40k fan), go to this link: https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/warhammer-40000/ . the datacards are only available as pdf download, sad!
